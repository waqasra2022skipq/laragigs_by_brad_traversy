# LaraGigs app

This app was build alongside [Brad Traversy Toturial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYyJ4PuL4pY) having this [Github Repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/laragigs/tree/main)

## Added Functionalities
 In place of comma separated tags I have added categories functionalities , whcih user can select , as many he wants, while adding new Job. That required two extra tables(categories and terms_relationship) to establish many-to-many relationship btw Listings and Categories. 

 In extra field and table column, expires,  was also added to add an expiry date to Job/Listing.
